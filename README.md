```

* `archived_pages` - Contains pages that are no longer in use but we keep around for historical reasons.

* `changelogs` - An orphaned directory, pay no mind

* `markdown` - The 'root' directory of the wiki itself. The root directory is structured to be similar to how you see it on the URL.

* `.vuepress/config` - Contains the configuration files for the wiki itself. For most editing you need only edit `arrays.js`.


`arrays.js` is self-explanatory for the most part. The path in each section tells you where to put the corresponding `.md` files into as well as showing you examples on how to add your own page.
